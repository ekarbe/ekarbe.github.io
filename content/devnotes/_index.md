This is where I write about my developments. This doesn't necessarily offer any added value and is just for the record. Maybe you will get some insights that will help you with your development. I tend to document things I struggled with or found interesting, hoping it might save you some time or inspire your own projects. Expect a mix of practical solutions, random discoveries, and occasional deep dives into whatever has caught my attention.
