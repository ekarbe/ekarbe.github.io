professional: "I've bounced between startups and bigger companies, picking up skills and battle scars along the way. My technical toolkit includes a bunch of programming languages and frameworks, but what I really care about is building systems that don't fall apart when things get busy."
endurance: "My approach to endurance sports is pretty simple: understand the science, test it on myself, and share what actually works. I'm not an elite athlete by any stretch, but I've logged enough miles to know what makes a difference versus what's just marketing noise."
ai: "What fascinates me about AI isn't the fancy techâ€”it's how these tools can solve real problems when applied thoughtfully. I try to cut through the hype and focus on practical applications that make life better or work easier."

I'm Eike, a developer who spends way too much time thinking about code architecture, training zones, and how AI might help with both. My day job involves solving technical puzzles, but my passion projects span across all three areas of this blog.

When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll probably find me on a trail or a bike, testing training theories on myself (sometimes successfully, sometimes... less so). I believe in finding balanceâ€”between technical depth and practical solutions, between pushing hard and recovering well, between embracing new tech and maintaining a healthy skepticism.

This blog is my way of documenting things I find interesting or useful, without the corporate polish or marketing fluff. If any of it helps you out or sparks a conversation, that's a bonus!
