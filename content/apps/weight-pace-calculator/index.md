Are you a runner wondering how **weight loss** might affect your **running speed**? The **Weight Pace Calculator** is designed to help you explore this relationship. Using established performance models, this web application provides insightful estimations, allowing you to visualize potential **pace improvements** as you work towards a target weight.

Getting started is simple: input your biological **gender, height, current weight**, and your current **lactate threshold pace** (in minutes and seconds per kilometer). For even more refined calculations, you can optionally include your **current body fat percentage**.

Based on your data, the calculator projects your estimated **threshold pace** and potential **race times** for common distances (5k, 10k, Half Marathon, and Marathon) at various target weights. The projections extend down to a minimum healthy weight, calculated using a BMI of 18.5.

### Key Features:
*   **Personalized Inputs:** Tailor calculations to your specific stats.
*   **Pace & Race Time Projections:** Visualize potential speed gains across standard race distances.
*   **Body Fat Estimation:** Understand potential body composition changes (requires initial BFP).
*   **Health Indicators:** Highlights minimum healthy weight and warns about potentially unhealthy low body fat percentages.
*   **Clear Warnings:** Provides context about the estimation model and its limitations.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works smoothly on desktop and mobile.
*   **Light/Dark Mode:** Adapts to your preferred theme.

**Disclaimer:** Remember, these are *estimates*. Real-world results depend on many factors including training, body composition changes (muscle vs. fat), genetics, and running efficiency. Use this tool for informational and motivational purposes, not as a substitute for professional advice.
