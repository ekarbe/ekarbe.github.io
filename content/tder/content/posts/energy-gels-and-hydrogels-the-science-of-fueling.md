# Why do some gels make you feel like you swallowed a brick while others keep you cruising?

We’ve all been there. You’re 15 miles into a marathon, your legs are burning, and you reach for a gel. You chug it down, wash it with water, and hope for the best. Suddenly, you feel a familiar sloshing in your stomach. A few miles later, you’re sprinting for a porta potty instead of a PR.

The difference between a fuel that works and one that ruins your run often comes down to the science of **osmolarity** and **carbohydrate absorption**. Let’s break down how to fuel like a scientist.

## The Golden Ratio: Glucose and Fructose

First, we need to understand the engine. When you run hard, you deplete your glycogen stores (the stored sugar in your muscles and liver). To keep going, you need to replace that fuel.

However, your body has a limit on how fast it can absorb carbohydrates from your gut into your bloodstream. It uses two different transporters for two different types of sugar:

1.  **Glucose:** Uses the SGLT1 transporter.
2.  **Fructose:** Uses the GLUT5 transporter.

If you only ingest glucose, your body hits a bottleneck. To maximize your **exogenous carbohydrate oxidation** (using outside fuel), you need to use both transporters simultaneously. This is why the industry standard is a **2:1 ratio of glucose to fructose**. This ratio allows you to absorb up to 90 grams of carbs per hour—enough to keep the wall at bay.

## The Hydrogel Revolution: What’s Different?

Enter the hydrogel. Brands like Maurten and SiS Beta Fuel have taken the endurance world by storm. But what makes them different from a standard gel?

### The Osmolarity Problem

Standard gels are essentially concentrated sugar syrups. When you drink a gel, you are introducing a high concentration of solutes into your stomach. This creates high **osmolarity**.

Think of osmolarity like a sponge. High osmolarity pulls water out of your body and into your gut to dilute the sugar. This causes bloating, slows down **gastric emptying** (how fast food leaves your stomach), and leads to GI distress.

### How Hydrogels Work

Hydrogels solve this by encapsulating the carbohydrates in a matrix of alginate (derived from seaweed) and peptides. Here is the magic:

1.  **In the bottle:** It’s a drinkable liquid.
2.  **In the stomach:** When it hits the acidic environment of your stomach, the alginate and peptides gel, forming a soft, jelly-like substance.

This gel "hides" the high concentration of carbohydrates. It effectively lowers the osmolarity, allowing the solution to pass through the stomach to the small intestine much faster than a syrupy gel. The enzymes in your small intestine then break down the gel to release the fuel.

## The Science Says It Works

We don’t have to guess. A randomized, double-blind study published in the *Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise* compared a standard glucose-fructose solution against a hydrogel version.

*   **Performance:** Runners using the hydrogel finished a 5km time trial **2.1% faster** than those using the standard solution.
*   **Oxidation:** They oxidized more of the fuel they consumed (68.6g vs 63.4g).
*   **Gut Comfort:** The hydrogel group reported significantly fewer gastrointestinal symptoms.

## Natural vs. Synthetic: Is "Real Food" Better?

You’ll see brands like Veloforte marketing themselves as "real food"—using fruit juices, ginger, and lemon instead of glucose syrup. These are excellent for shorter distances or for runners with sensitive stomachs who can't handle the high sugar load.

However, for ultra-endurance events, the carb density is often lower. If you need 90g of carbs, you might have to eat three or four of these natural gels, which can be messy and time-consuming. The science supports the high-density, isotonic hydrogels for high-volume fueling.

## Practical Takeaway: How to Fuel Like a Pro

1.  **Don’t wait for the wall.** Start fueling at mile 4 or 5, not when you feel empty.
2.  **Stick to the ratio.** Look for a 2:1 glucose-fructose ratio on the label.
3.  **Hydrate smart.** Hydrogels are isotonic (similar to your body's fluids), so you don't need to chug a liter of water with them. Too much water can actually flush the gel out of your stomach too quickly. Sip, don't gulp.
4.  **Test it.** If you’ve never used hydrogels, don’t try them on race day. Practice during training runs.
