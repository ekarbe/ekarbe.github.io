# Is Your Water Bottle Killing Your Glycogen Stores?

Most recreational runners view hydration as a simple arithmetic problem: sweat lost = water drunk. They believe that maintaining a high fluid volume prevents the "bonk" and sustains performance. This is a dangerous oversimplification. The relationship between fluid intake and glycogen depletion is a complex metabolic feedback loop where the pursuit of euhydration can inadvertently accelerate glycogenolysis.

## The Glycogen-Water Bond

To understand the mechanism, we must look at the molecular structure of the fuel source. Glycogen is not a dry, inert powder; it is a hydrophilic polymer. Research indicates that glycogen is stored in the muscle linked to at least 3 grams of water per gram of glycogen. This water is integral to the structural integrity of the storage granules. When you dehydrate, you aren't just losing a fluid; you are destabilizing the intracellular environment that houses your energy reserves.

## The Thermal Cost of Dehydration

The primary driver of glycogen depletion is not the duration of the run, but the thermal stress imposed on the body. Hyperthermia accelerates dehydration and leads to glycolysis malfunction. When muscle temperature rises, the body increases glycogen expenditure to fuel the ATP hydrolysis in myosin heads and the chemical reactions in the Krebs cycle required for thermoregulation.

A systematic review confirms that exercising in a hot environment (41 °C) significantly increased the utilization of intramuscular glycogen compared to cold environments (9 °C). Therefore, when you run dehydrated, you are not just burning fuel; you are burning fuel to generate heat, which then necessitates further fuel consumption to cool down. This creates a vicious cycle where mild hypohydration accelerates the rate at which you hit the 100 mmol·kg −1 glycogen threshold associated with the "wall."

## The Contrarian View: The Weight of Water

The standard advice is to drink until you are not thirsty and to carry a hydration pack. However, this ignores the metabolic cost of carrying mass. A study on trail runners demonstrated that carrying a fully loaded pack (3.4kg) increased the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and cardiovascular strain, even when heart rate remained statistically similar. Carrying 4-5% of your body weight in water and gear adds metabolic load that consumes the very glycogen you are trying to spare.

Furthermore, excessive fluid intake can lead to hyperhydration, diluting electrolytes and potentially causing hyponatremia. The body prioritizes plasma volume restoration over intramuscular hydration during exercise. If you over-hydrate, you dilute the sodium necessary for proper muscle contraction and nerve signaling, leading to early fatigue and cramping—not because of a lack of fuel, but because of a lack of electrolyte balance.

## The Optimal Strategy: Fuel First, Hydrate Second

To preserve glycogen without the metabolic penalty of carrying excessive weight or over-hydrating, you must decouple fuel from fluid intake. The goal is to maintain euhydration for thermoregulation, not to flood the system.

1.  **Early Intervention:** The most common error is waiting until glycogen stores are critically low to start fueling. A computational study showed athletes running at 80-95% VO2max hit glycogen depletion around mile 21. You must begin fuel consumption at 30-45 minutes into the run. This prevents the sudden energy deficit that derails performance in the final 10K.

2.  **The 30-60g Protocol:** Target 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour for any effort exceeding 90 minutes. This rate is the ceiling for intestinal absorption. Deliver this in small, frequent doses of 8-15 grams every 15-20 minutes.

3.  **Osmolality Management:** Do not mix concentrated carbohydrates with sports drinks. Combining high-concentration gels with water increases osmolality, raising the risk of GI distress. Use water only for fuel delivery to ensure rapid gastric emptying and absorption.

## The Takeaway

Your hydration strategy should be about thermal efficiency, not volume. Do not rely on thirst, which is a delayed indicator of hypohydration. Instead, implement a rigid fueling schedule to top off glycogen stores early, and hydrate only to the point where you are thermally comfortable, minimizing the weight you carry and the metabolic strain you induce.

- **Action Item:** On your next long run (90+ minutes), set a timer to beep every 20 minutes. Consume a gel or chew (15g carbs) with water only. Do not drink sports drinks with the gel. Do not wait until you feel hungry or thirsty to start.
