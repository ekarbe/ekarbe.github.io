# The Secret to Running Faster: How to Train Your Body to Clear Lactate

We’ve all been there. You’re cruising along at a pace you think is solid, maybe a bit faster than your usual long run, and suddenly—bam. The legs feel like lead, your breathing turns ragged, and that familiar burning sensation hits your quads. You instinctively think, *"Lactic acid. I’m drowning in it."*

But what if I told you that the thing you’re trying to avoid is actually your best friend? And what if I told you that the traditional way you’ve been training to fix this problem might be holding you back?

Let’s dive into the science of lactate, debunk the myths, and explore unconventional training strategies that will help you run faster and longer without the dreaded bonk.

## The Great Lactic Acid Myth

For decades, coaches and runners have feared the word "lactic acid." We treat it like an evil villain that accumulates in your muscles and paralyzes you at mile 20 of a marathon. But modern physiology has flipped the script on this old-school thinking.

Lactate isn’t the enemy. In fact, it’s a highly efficient fuel source. When you run, your body breaks down glucose to create energy. A byproduct of this process is lactate. During easy runs, your body is so efficient at clearing this lactate—recycling it back into energy via the Cori Cycle—that you barely notice it.

So, what causes the burn? It’s not the lactate itself. It’s the **hydrogen ions**. For every molecule of lactate your body produces, it also releases a hydrogen ion. These ions lower the pH in your muscles, making them acidic. This acidity irritates nerve endings and causes that heavy, burning sensation we associate with fatigue.

**The Takeaway:** You don’t need to train to produce *less* lactate. You need to train your body to clear it faster so you can keep producing energy without the pH dropping to dangerous levels.

## What is Lactate Threshold?

To understand how to train for clearance, we first need to define the boundary line: the Lactate Threshold (LT).

Your lactate threshold is the running speed at which your body produces lactate faster than it can clear it. It’s the tipping point where your "sustainable hard pace" begins to crumble. If you could run at your LT pace forever, you’d be a marathon world record holder.

For a sub-4 hour marathoner, this threshold is roughly half-marathon effort. If you can hold a pace that feels like a 15K or half-marathon race for the full 26.2 miles, you’re golden.

The problem is, if you only run easy miles or traditional tempo runs, you aren’t necessarily training your body to clear lactate at *race pace*. You’re just teaching it to clear lactate at a comfortable, conversational pace.

## Why Traditional Tempo Runs Aren't Enough

Most training plans include "tempo runs"—a steady, hard effort for 20 to 30 minutes. While this is great for general fitness, it has a major flaw regarding lactate clearance.

When you run a tempo run, your lactate production and clearance rates are relatively constant. Your body is in a steady state. While this builds endurance, it doesn’t stress the system enough to force an adaptation where you can clear lactate *faster* than you currently do.

Think of it this way: If you want to get better at math, you don’t just do the same easy addition problems every day. You need to be challenged with harder problems that force your brain to develop new strategies. Similarly, to improve your lactate threshold, you need workouts that stress your clearing mechanisms at faster speeds.

## The Unconventional Strategy: Alternations and Cruise Intervals

Here is where we get into the good stuff. Elite coaches and scientists have developed specific workouts designed to train your body to clear lactate at race speeds.

### 1. Alternations

This is a workout popularized by coaches like Renato Canova. The concept is simple but effective: **undulation**.

Instead of running at a steady, uncomfortable tempo, you alternate between segments of slightly faster running and segments of slightly slower running.

*   **The Setup:** For a half-marathon or shorter race, you might run one segment at race pace and one segment slightly slower than your traditional tempo pace.
*   **The Mechanism:** When you run the faster segment, you produce lactate. When you drop to the slower segment, your body gets a chance to clear that lactate. This creates a "wave" of lactate in your system rather than a flat line.
*   **The Benefit:** This trains your body to clear lactate *at race pace*. It forces your clearing mechanisms to work harder and faster than they would in a standard tempo run.

### 2. Cruise Intervals

Another powerful tool is the cruise interval. This involves running a hard effort (like 5k or 10k pace) followed by a recovery jog.

*   **The Setup:** Run 1 mile at 10k pace, then jog for 3 minutes to recover. Repeat 4 to 6 times.
*   **The Mechanism:** The hard effort spikes your lactate production. The recovery jog allows your body to clear it. The key here is the recovery time. You aren’t just running easy miles; you are exposing your body to high levels of lactate and then demanding it clear it before the next hard effort.

## The Science of Mitochondria

Why do these workouts work? It comes down to biology. When you stress your body with these high-intensity efforts, you trigger a physiological response. You increase the density of your mitochondria—the power plants of your cells.

More mitochondria mean your body can process fuel more efficiently. It can oxidize lactate and use it as a fuel source more effectively. You become a more efficient machine. This is why high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) are so potent. They create a massive "metabolic disturbance" that forces your body to adapt.

## Practical Application for Your Training

So, how do you fit this into your weekly schedule? You don’t need to overhaul everything, but you should introduce variety.

1.  **Stop fearing the burn:** Accept that lactate is fuel. The burn is just a signal that your body is working hard and producing energy.
2.  **Add Alternations:** Once a week, try a workout where you alternate between a faster segment and a recovery segment. This is excellent for building threshold without the monotony of a long tempo run.
3.  **Test your Threshold:** Before you can improve, you need to know where you stand. Do a simple time trial (like a 5k or 10k) to find your current LT pace. Use this as your benchmark.
4.  **Recovery is Key:** The harder you spike your lactate, the more important recovery becomes. Ensure you are getting enough sleep and nutrition to support the repair of your mitochondria.

## The Bottom Line

The goal of training isn’t to produce less lactate; it’s to become a lactate-clearing machine. By moving away from simple tempo runs and embracing strategies like alternations and cruise intervals, you can push your lactate threshold higher.

This means you can hold a faster pace for longer, recover quicker between hard sessions, and finally crush that marathon goal without hitting the wall.

It’s time to stop running from the burn and start running on it.
